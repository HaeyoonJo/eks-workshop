      <description>App Mesh is made up of the following components:
 Service mesh: A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between the services that reside within it. For more information, see Service Meshes.
 Virtual nodes: A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an ECS service or a Kubernetes deployment. When you create a virtual node, you must specify the DNS service discovery name for your task group.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll first create the actual App Mesh. Copy and paste the following into your terminal to create an App Mesh called APP_MESH_DEMO.
aws appmesh create-mesh --mesh-name APP_MESH_DEMO  </description>

      <description>Next, we&amp;rsquo;ll create five Virtual Nodes, one for each of the microservices in our application.
More about Virtual Nodes A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a k8s service.
Service Discovery / DNS name of the virtual node is defined in the serviceDiscovery.dns attribute.
Inbound traffic parameters for the virtual node are specified in the listener attribute.
Outbound traffic the virtual node forwards to should be specified in the backend attribute.</description>

      <description>Virtual routers handle traffic for one or more service names within your mesh. After you create a virtual router, you can create and associate routes for your virtual router that direct incoming requests to different virtual nodes.
Next, we&amp;rsquo;ll create two Virtual Routers.
Creating the routers Each service name within the mesh must be fronted by a virtual router, and the service name you specify for the virtual router must be a real DNS service name within your VPC.</description>

      <description>Up to this point, we&amp;rsquo;ve created all required components of the app mesh (virtual nodes, virtual routers, and routes) to support our application. In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;ll actually deploy the k8s application.
Deploying the k8s Colorteller App To deploy app, copy and paste the following into your terminal:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geremyCohen/colorapp/master/colorapp.yaml  Deploying Curler In addition to deploying the application, we&amp;rsquo;ll also deploy Curler, which is a simple image that provide curl functionality.</description>

      <description>We now have both App Mesh and the application deployed. Next comes the fun part of seeing how we can use App Mesh to change the charactertics of the application.
Open Two Terminals You should already have one terminal open. Click the widget on the Cloud9 GUI and open a second terminal.
Use curler to fetch the application response In the first terminal, run the following command to connect to the curler pod with a bash shell (you may be prompted to hit enter to get a command line prompt):</description>
